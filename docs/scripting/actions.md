# `.cmgscript` Actions

All actions fail fast. If an action fails, later actions are not executed.

## `navigate`

```text
navigate "<url-or-path>"
```

Navigates the primary page target to a URL, data URL, or local file path.

On success, stdout includes a `NAVIGATED <line> <final-url>` line after the `PASS` line. Local file paths must exist; missing path-like targets fail before the browser is asked to navigate.

Example:

```text
navigate "C:\Projects\CMG\index.html"
```

## `waitForElement`

```text
waitForElement "<selector>" timeout=5000
```

Waits until a selector exists in any available page target.

Options:

- `timeout`: Optional timeout in milliseconds. Default is `5000`.

Example:

```text
waitForElement "#openProfileDialog" timeout=5000
```

## `click`

```text
click "<selector>"
```

Clicks the element in the selected browser. `click` does not scroll automatically; the element center must already be inside the current viewport. Use `scrollIntoView` first when the script should move the page.

Example:

```text
click "#openProfileDialog"
```

## `type`

```text
type "<selector>" "text"
```

Focuses the element without scrolling, appends text to its current value, and dispatches `input` and `change` events. The element center must already be inside the current viewport. Use `scrollIntoView` first when the script should move the page.

Example:

```text
type "#profileName" "CMG Test Profile"
```

## `clear`

```text
clear "<selector>"
```

Focuses the element without scrolling, clears its value, and dispatches `input` and `change` events. The element center must already be inside the current viewport. Use `scrollIntoView` first when the script should move the page.

Example:

```text
clear "#profileName"
```

## `press`

```text
press "Enter"
```

Dispatches key down and key up behavior in the selected browser.

Example:

```text
press "Escape"
```

## `hover`

```text
hover "<selector>"
```

Dispatches mouseover and mousemove events at the element center. `hover` does not scroll automatically; the element center must already be inside the current viewport.

Example:

```text
hover "#openProfileDialog"
```

## `scrollIntoView`

```text
scrollIntoView "<selector>"
```

Scrolls an element into the center of the viewport.

Example:

```text
scrollIntoView "#dragdrop"
```

## `select`

```text
select "<selector>" "value"
```

Sets a select-like element value and dispatches `input` and `change` events. `select` does not scroll automatically; the element center must already be inside the current viewport.

Example:

```text
select "#environment" "prod"
```

## `showMessageBar`

```text
showMessageBar "message"
```

Injects or updates a fixed caption bar near the top center of the page with a custom message. The bar dynamically sizes to the message, supports multi-line text, uses the browser top layer when available so it appears above page dialogs, is visible in screenshots and GIF recordings, and does not intercept pointer input.

Example:

```text
showMessageBar "Opening the profile dialog"
showMessageBar "Opening profile dialog\nWaiting for dialog content"
```

## `delay`

```text
delay 1000
```

Pauses execution for the specified number of milliseconds.

## `html`

```text
html "<selector>"
```

Prints the selected element's `outerHTML` to stdout as an `HTML` result line.

Example:

```text
html "#openProfileDialog"
```

## `screenshot`

```text
screenshot "<selector>" output="element.png"
screenshot "<selector>"
```

Captures a PNG screenshot of an element.

Options:

- `output`: Optional file path. Without it, stdout receives a `data:image/png;base64,...` result.

## `screenshotPage`

```text
screenshotPage output="page.png"
screenshotPage
```

Captures a PNG screenshot of the primary page target.

Options:

- `output`: Optional file path. Without it, stdout receives a `data:image/png;base64,...` result.

## `assertText`

```text
assertText "<selector>" "expected text"
```

Reads an element's visible text and fails unless it contains the expected text.

Example:

```text
assertText "#lastDialogAction" "None"
```

## `evaluate`

```text
evaluate "document.title"
```

Evaluates JavaScript in the primary page target and prints the returned value as an `EVALUATE` result line.

## `setViewport`

```text
setViewport width=1280 height=720
```

Sets viewport metrics for the primary page target.

Required options:

- `width`
- `height`

## `dragAndDrop`

```text
dragAndDrop "<sourceSelector>" "<targetSelector>"
dragAndDrop "<sourceSelector>" {
  delay 200
  hover "<selector>"
  drop "<targetSelector>"
}
```

Dispatches drag-and-drop DOM events from the source element to the target element.

Simple drag-and-drop does not scroll automatically. The source and target centers must both already be inside the current viewport. Use `scrollIntoView` and, when needed, a large enough viewport before dragging.

Example:

```text
dragAndDrop "[data-command='browser launch']" "#dropQueue"
```

The block form is the complex drag sequence. It has no inline target selector; the target is provided by the required `drop` child action.

Allowed child actions:

- `delay <milliseconds>`: Pause while the drag is active. With `--gif`, frames are captured during the hold.
- `hover "<selector>"`: Move the active drag pointer to another element.
- `scrollIntoView "<selector>"`: Scroll an element into view before continuing.
- `waitForElement "<selector>" timeout=5000`: Wait for an element before continuing.
- `drop "<selector>"`: Finish the drag on the target selector. Required exactly once.

Rules:

- The block form must have exactly one source selector argument.
- The block must contain exactly one `drop`.
- No actions are allowed after `drop`.
- Other child actions fail with `Action '<name>' is not supported inside block dragAndDrop.`
- With `--gif`, CMG keeps the drag lifecycle active while the body runs so page-owned drag ghosts can stay visible.
- If the page does not call `DataTransfer.setDragImage()`, CMG shows a default-preview bridge during the active drag so the live browser and GIF still show a browser-style default drag preview.

Complex example:

```text
dragAndDrop "[data-command='browser launch']" {
  delay 200
  hover "#lastDialogAction"
  delay 200
  hover "#dropQueue"
  drop "#dropQueue"
}
```

## `listTabs`

```text
listTabs
```

Prints available page targets as `TAB` result lines.

## `activateTab`

```text
activateTab index=0
```

Activates a tab by index from `listTabs`.

Required options:

- `index`

## `closeTab`

```text
closeTab index=1
```

Closes a tab by index from `listTabs`.

Required options:

- `index`

## `set`

```text
set name "value"
```

Stores a variable for later `${name}` expansion.

Example:

```text
set target "#openProfileDialog"
click "${target}"
```
